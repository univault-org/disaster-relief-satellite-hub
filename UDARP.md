# UDARP: Ultrasonic Dynamic Adaptive Resonance Profiling

## Definition
UDARP (Ultrasonic Dynamic Adaptive Resonance Profiling) is a comprehensive approach to optimizing ultrasonic communication between two devices. It involves dynamically adjusting parameters, adapting to environmental changes, finding resonant frequencies, and creating device-specific profiles for efficient communication.

## Components
1. Ultrasonic: High-frequency sound waves used for data transmission
2. Dynamic: Real-time adjustment of communication parameters
3. Adaptive: Learning and improving performance over time
4. Resonance: Finding optimal frequency and modulation for clear transmission
5. Profiling: Creating and maintaining unique configurations for device pairs

## UDARP Equation Modeling

The UDARP equation aims to find the optimal set of parameters for ultrasonic communication between two devices. Let's define the equation as:

UDARP(D1, D2, E) = argmax[Q(P, D1, D2, E)]

Where:
- D1, D2: Device 1 and Device 2 characteristics
- E: Environmental factors
- P: Set of communication parameters
- Q: Quality function that measures communication effectiveness

### Parameters (P)
P = {f, a, m, b, t, df, spf, pd}
- f: Frequency
- a: Amplitude
- m: Modulation scheme
- b: Bit rate
- t: Transmission power
- df: Frequency shift
- spf: Samples per frame
- pd: Preamble duration

### Device Characteristics (D)
D = {s, n, r, c}
- s: Speaker/microphone sensitivity
- n: Noise floor
- r: Frequency response range
- c: Processing capability

### Environmental Factors (E)
E = {a, h, t, i}
- a: Ambient noise level
- h: Humidity
- t: Temperature
- i: Interference sources

### Quality Function (Q)
Q = w1*SNR + w2*BER + w3*L + w4*E
- SNR: Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- BER: Bit Error Rate
- L: Latency
- E: Energy efficiency
- w1, w2, w3, w4: Weighting factors

## Solving the UDARP Equation

To solve the UDARP equation and find the optimal profile:

1. Initialize with default or previously stored parameters.
2. Measure current environmental factors (E).
3. Evaluate the quality function Q for the current setup.
4. Use optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, genetic algorithms) to iteratively adjust parameters P.
5. Re-evaluate Q after each adjustment.
6. Continue until Q reaches a maximum or satisfactory threshold.
7. Store the optimal P as the profile for the current D1-D2 pair.

## Implementation Plan

1. Develop sensors and algorithms to measure D and E factors.
2. Implement the quality function Q and its component measurements.
3. Create an optimization algorithm to solve the UDARP equation.
4. Design a database to store and retrieve device profiles.
5. Develop real-time adjustment mechanisms for dynamic optimization.
6. Implement adaptive learning to improve profiles over time.
7. Create a protocol for devices to exchange D factors and negotiate initial parameters.
8. Develop a user interface for manual control and monitoring of the UDARP process.

## Current Implementation

### PWA (Sender) Side:
- Initializes UDARP parameters (f, a, m, b, t, df, spf, pd).
- Measures simulated environmental parameters.
- Adjusts UDARP parameters based on measurements.
- Generates and transmits ultrasonic signal with known bit pattern.
- Simulates feedback and adjusts parameters for multiple attempts.

### C++ (Receiver) Side:
- Initializes matching UDARP parameters.
- Measures simulated environmental parameters.
- Adjusts UDARP parameters based on measurements.
- Listens for ultrasonic signal and attempts to decode known bit pattern.
- Adjusts parameters for multiple reception attempts.

### Test Process:
- Simulates multiple transmission/reception attempts.
- Adjusts parameters to find optimal configuration.
- Aims to successfully transmit and receive known bit pattern.
- Outputs final UDARP profile upon success.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- Implement real-time communication between PWA and C++ application.
- Develop actual environmental measurement capabilities.
- Test with real ultrasonic transmissions in various environments.
- Implement more sophisticated parameter adjustment algorithms.
- Develop a negotiation process for sender and receiver to agree on optimal parameters.

## Next Steps

1. Define specific ranges and units for each parameter in P, D, and E.
2. Develop detailed algorithms for measuring each component of Q.
3. Choose and implement a suitable optimization algorithm.
4. Begin prototyping the UDARP system with basic hardware setups.
5. Implement real-time feedback mechanism between sender and receiver.
6. Develop more accurate environmental measurement techniques.
7. Test and refine the system in various real-world scenarios.
